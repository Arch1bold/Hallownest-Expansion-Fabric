# The Hallownest Expansion Mod

Beneath the surface of the Overworld sleeps a long-forgotten kingdom. Many are drawn below the surface, searching for
riches, glory, or answers to old secrets.

The Hallownest Expansion is a Fabric mod that includes new features, blocks, weapons, and much more. We aim to add to
the interesting action, adventure and exploration across the already feature-rich world of Minecraft while paying homage
to Team Cherry’s masterpiece, Hollow Knight.

Defeat tainted creatures, befriend bizarre bugs, and solve ancient mysteries at the kingdom's heart. If you like fun
gameplay, cute but creepy characters, epic adventures and beautiful, gothic worlds, then the kingdom of Hallownest
awaits!

## Features:

- Explore a vast, diverse world of forgotten highways, overgrown wilds and ruined cities.
- Use a Nail to strike down your enemies. Upgrade this deadly blade with Pale Ore and Enchantments to make it even
  stronger.
- Strengthen yourself with powerful new tools, items and abilities! Leap to new heights on ethereal wings. Dash forward
  in a blinding flash. Leap into minds with the Dream Nail.
- Meet an enormous cast of cute and creepy creatures that Hollow Knight fans should all know and love.
- Face ferocious beasts and vanquish ancient knights on your quest through the kingdom. Track down every last twisted
  foe and add them to your Hunter's Journal.
